ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio
Hi there! I'm glad you're here.

This GitHub repo is a collection of data science projects Iâ€™ve worked on to build and sharpen my skills in areas like data analysis, machine learning, and data storytelling. Most of these started from curiosity â€” trying to make sense of data, solve real problems, or just experiment with new tools.

ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Inside
Youâ€™ll find a mix of:

Exploratory data analysis projects

Machine learning models for prediction and classification

A few deep learning experiments (just to stretch my brain!)

Projects inspired by real-world datasets and challenges

Each project folder has a short write-up (README) explaining what the project is about, how I approached it, and what I learned along the way. Iâ€™ve also included code notebooks, visuals, and any useful links or resources.

ðŸ›  Tools I Often Use
Python (of course)

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebooks

Sometimes: SQL, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and a bit of web scraping
